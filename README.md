- ![vim](https://www.vim.org)

### Installation guide:
1. Clone the repository in a local directory.
<a id="step-2"></a>
2. Create a `bin/` subdirectory within `~/.local/` with
    ```
    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/
    ```
    - `~/.local/bin/` is recommended however any directory is sufficient.
3. If the above directory (or your chosen directory) is not already present, add it to `PATH` using
    ```
    $ export PATH="$HOMÂ£/.local/bin/:$PATH"
    ```
    - You can check the directories in `PATH` with `echo $PATH`
4. `cd` into the cloned repo and copy `dear-diary.sh` into the directory using:
    ```
    $ cp dear-diary.sh ~/.local/bin/dear-diary
    ```
    - Make sure the copied file does not include the `.sh` file extension.
    - If using a different directory, change the second directory accordingly.

NOTE:
- If you want to keep this feature in all future sessions, append `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/:$PATH"` to your shell configuration file.
- Changes to `dear-diary.sh` will not be applied unless re-copied into the binary directory chosen in [step 2](#step-2).

$ dear-diary file
