# dear-diary

###Â Aim
dear-diary is a bash script that will act as a command line secret journal. The user will be able to call the command and create and edit a text file that is then encrypted and password protected
upon closing.

This project aims to apply a few programming practices:
1) Test Driven Development (TDD):
	- Test scripts will be written before feature implementation.
 2) Automated Testing:
	- Bash scripts will be created to automate the testing of the command.
 3) Bash:
	- The command script and all test scripts will be written in bash.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
The MVP will be called as follows:
```
$ dear-diary [file]
```

And will have the following design:
